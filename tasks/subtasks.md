# Event Aggregator Service - Development Subtasks

This checklist breaks down the work required to build the V1 Event Aggregator Service, based on the Product Requirements Document.

## Milestone 1: Project Setup & Foundation ✅

- [x] **Initialize Supabase Edge Function:** Create a new Edge Function within your Supabase project named `event-aggregator`.
- [x] **Configure Environment Variables:** In the Supabase project settings, securely add placeholders for `EVENTBRITE_API_KEY`, `MEETUP_API_KEY`, and `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY`.
- [x] **Define Standard Event Type:** Create a TypeScript interface (`types/events.ts`) for the standard `Event` object. This will ensure type safety across the project.
- [x] **Create Supabase Client:** Set up a shared Supabase client instance to interact with your database from the Edge Function.
- [x] **Structure Project Files:** Create the initial file structure:
  - `index.ts` (Main function entry point, will act as the Conductor)
  - `lib/sync.ts` (For database logic)
  - `lib/adapters/` (Folder for API adapters)

## Milestone 2: Build the First API Adapter (Eventbrite) ✅

- [x] **API Research:** Read the Eventbrite API documentation to identify the best endpoint for discovering public events.
- [x] **Create Adapter Module:** Create the file `lib/adapters/eventbrite.ts`.
- [x] **Implement API Call:** Write the function to fetch data from the Eventbrite API using its authentication method.
- [x] **Implement Data Transformer:** Write the logic to map the raw Eventbrite event data to your standard `Event` object.
- [x] **Unit Test Adapter:** Write a simple test to ensure the transformer correctly maps sample data.
- [x] **Integrate into Conductor:** Call the new Eventbrite adapter from the main `index.ts` function and log the results.

## Milestone 3: Database Synchronization ✅

- [x] **Develop Upsert Logic:** In `lib/sync.ts`, write the `syncEventsToDatabase` function.
- [x] **Query Existing Events:** The function should first check the `events` table for events matching the `sourceEventId` from the incoming data.
- [x] **Implement `INSERT`:** If an event is new, insert it into the `events` table.
- [x] **Implement `UPDATE`:** If an event already exists, update its fields with the new data.
- [x] **Connect to Conductor:** Call the `syncEventsToDatabase` function from `index.ts` after fetching events from the adapter(s).

## Milestone 4: Expansion & Finalization ✅

- [x] **Build Meetup Adapter:** Create `lib/adapters/meetup.ts` and repeat the steps from Milestone 2.
- [x] **Build Ticketmaster Adapter:** Create `lib/adapters/ticketmaster.ts` and repeat the steps from Milestone 2.
- [x] **Implement Logging:** Add comprehensive logging throughout the entire process to track successes, fetched counts, and errors.
- [x] **Finalize Conductor Logic:** Update `index.ts` to call all three adapters and process their results together.
- [x] **Configure Cron Schedule:** In your `supabase/config.toml` file, set the schedule for the function to run every 6 hours (`schedule = "0 */6 * * *"`).

## Milestone 5: Deployment & Monitoring ✅

- [x] **Deploy the Edge Function:** Use the Supabase CLI to deploy the `event-aggregator` function (`supabase functions deploy event-aggregator`).
- [x] **Set up CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment.
- [x] **Live Monitoring:** Monitor the function's first few scheduled runs from the Supabase dashboard logs.
- [x] **Data Verification:** Manually check the `events` table in your Supabase project to confirm that data is being populated and updated correctly.
- [x] **Celebrate!** You've successfully built an automated data pipeline.
